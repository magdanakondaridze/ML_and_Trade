"), and Rules ("") annexed thereto, published in 
Rossiyskaya Gazeta No 5873 of 31 August 2012. 
For each of these measures, this request also covers any amendments, replacements, 
extensions, implementing measures or other related measures, including any act of Russia's 
Parliament or Russia's executive that would conf
irm, extend, amend, or otherwise affect the 
measures in question.  
The European Union considers that these measures are inconsistent with Russia's obligations 
under the following WTO provisions: 
 Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 because Russia has failed to accord any advantage, favour, 
privilege or immunity granted to products originating in any other countries immediately 

and unconditionally to the like products originating in the territories of all other 
Members, notably the European Union;  
 Article II:1 (a) and (b) of the GATT 1994 because Russia failed to accord to commerce of 
another Member treatment no less favourable 
than that provided for in the appropriate 
Part of the Schedule annexed to the GATT 
1994; because Russia has failed to exempt 
products which are the products of territories of another Member, on their importation 

into Russia's territory, from ordinary customs duties in excess of those set forth and 
provided in Russia's Schedule, and because Russia has failed to exempt such products 
from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with the 

importation in excess of those imposed on the 
date of this Agreement or those directly 
and mandatorily required to be imposed thereafter by legislation in force in the 
importing territory on that date;  
 Article III:2 of the GATT 1994 because Russia subj
ects the products of the territory of 
other Members imported to the territory of Russia, directly or indirectly, to internal taxes 
or other internal charges of any kind in excess of those applied, directly or indirectly, to 
like domestic products. Russia has also applied internal taxes or other internal charges 

to imported or domestic products in a manner contrary to the principles set forth in 
paragraph 1 of Article III of the GATT 1994; 
 Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 because the measures accord less favourable treatment to 
imported products than that accorded to like products originating in Russia in respect of 

all laws, regulations, and requirements affecting their internal sale, offering for sale, 
purchase, transportation, distribution or use;  
 Article 2.1 and 2.2 of the TRIMs Agreement in
 conjunction with paragraphs 1(a) and/or 
2(a) of the Illustrative List annexed to the TRIMs Agreement because the measures are 
trade related investment measures, compliance with which is necessary to obtain an 
advantage and which require the purchase or use by an enterprise of products of 

domestic origin or from any domestic source and/or which restrict the importation by an 
enterprise of products used in or related to its local production.  
Accordingly, the European Union respectfully 
requests the establishment of a Panel with 
standard terms of reference in accordance with Article 7.1 of the DSU.  
The European Union asks that this request be placed on the agenda for the meeting of the 
Dispute Settlement Body to be held on 22 October 2013.
